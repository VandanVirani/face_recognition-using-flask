# face_recognition-using-flask

    
   #### In this project we are going to make a model which predict new faces by using stored face data. we are using flask module in order to interact with html webpage.

   #### It is the basic model for face recognition system, you can enhance with your flask skill.
   
### First step we are going to make our face data folder to store face embeddings. face embeddings is the number of face features (about 120) of image for example the distance between nose and eyes, between two eyes etc.
