# face_recognition-using-flask

    
   #### In this project we are going to make a model which predict new faces by using stored face data. we are using flask module in order to interact with html webpage.

   #### It is the basic model for face recognition system, you can enhance with your flask skill.
   
#### First we will make templates folder having index html for requirement of flask module. 
#### Second we will make image folder and store the similar image like 
```image  (folder)
      -person1  (folder)
         -p1_image_1
         -p1_image_2
         -p1_image_3
         -p1_image_4
      
      -person2  (folder)
         -p2_image_1
         -p2_image_2
         -p2_image_3
         -p2_image_4
         
      -person3  (folder)
         -p3_image_1
         -p3_image_2
         -p3_image_3
         -p3_image_4
```
#### Third we will make encodings folder, and make empty folder similar to image.
```encodings  (folder)
      -person1  (folder)
      
      -person2  (folder)
         
      -person3  (folder)

```

we are going to make our face data folder to store face encodings. face encodings is the number of face features (about 120) of image for example the distance between nose and eyes, between two eyes etc.
